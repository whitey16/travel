          <h2>April 28th - April 30th, 2017</h2>
          <p><span>W</span>e arrived in Hong Kong at about 9:30 in the morning. The Hong Kong airport is to the northwest of the city, but it is very easy to get into town via the Airport Express. Just head to the ticket counter and grab an express ticket for about 5 bucks per person or so.  We stayed in a hotel for this spot. A pretty nice one at that, called the Harbour Grand Kowloon. We got a pretty decent deal though, at about $150/night, which is not too shabby given the hotel and the location. There are definitely cheaper options, but we wanted to start the trip with a bit of luxury. The hotel is located on the Kowloon side of the harbour, and offers some spectacular views of the Hong Kong skyline. Rooftop pool was pretty sick, even though the “whirlpool” was just a pool with bubbles, not a hot tub...lame.</p>
